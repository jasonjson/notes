## Style

* Writing a comment block explain what the code is doing is better than doing so for every few lines of code. If a somewhat complex algorithm is being used, consider including a link to an article explaining the pattern and providing other examples of its use.
* **PEP 8** designates that two blank lines should seperate "top level" classes and function definitions in a module. After the top level, class and function definitions should be seperated by one blank line each.
* Consider keeping imports grouped by the packages that they come from. Within each group, sort imports by alphabetical order.
* Ensure that comments are kept up to date. If the code changes, the comments may need to change along with it. You do not want to end up with a series of comments that actually contradict the code.
